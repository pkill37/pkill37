## Hi there 👋

I research security vulnerabilities and system internals through reverse engineering. My work focuses on firmware, bootloaders, trusted execution environments, and low-level system programming.

From 2020 to 2025, I led reverse engineering efforts at Bliq to compete against Uber, Bolt, and Lyft in an epic reverse engineering cat and mouse game. I was analyzing Android platform security, Linux kernel, TrustZone firmware, and bootloader security, and building tools for reverse engineering and security research.

Now I am freelancing in security research and reverse engineering, while also building micro SaaS startups, including BrainSpeed.ai, Reverser.dev, and Explorar.dev. Recently people really liked my Linux Kernel Explorer!
